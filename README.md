# Influenza_Season_in_USA
This project creates a data-driven staffing plan for U.S. hospitals during influenza season, when demand surges. Using data on flu deaths, patient visits, lab tests, and vaccination, it forecasts needs and guides deployment of limited nurses, PAs, and doctors. The aim is to minimize staffing gaps and ensure timely care.
