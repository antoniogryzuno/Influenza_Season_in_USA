# Influenza_Season_in_USA
This project creates a data-driven staffing plan for U.S. hospitals during influenza season.

## ABOUT THE PROJECT
Each winter, the United States experiences an influenza season in which flu incidence spikes and a portion of patients—especially those in vulnerable populations—develop complications that require hospitalization. Hospitals and clinics face short‑term surges that outstrip normal staffing levels. A national medical staffing agency supplies temporary clinicians to cover these peaks.
This project builds a data‑driven plan to determine when to send staff and how many to dispatch to each state during the upcoming flu season.

## OBJECTIVE 
Determine when to send staff, and how many, to each state.

## SUCCESS FACTORS
- A staffing plan that utilizes all available agency staff per state requirements, without necessitating additional resources 
- Minimal instances of understaffing and overstaffing across states (a state can be considered understaffed if the staff-to-patient ratio is lower than 90% of the required ratio and overstaffed if greater than 110%

## AGE GROUPS ANALYSIS 
I have divided the influenza death numbers into two age groups: under 65 years old and over 65 years old. By making some analysis we decided to concentrate on the second group, since it supposed to be more vulnerable to deaths from influenza. 

## STAKEHOLDERS
- Hospitals and clinics
- Staffing agency administrators
- Medical agency frontline staff (nurses, physician assistants, and doctors)
- Influenza patients

## GEOGRAPHY 
All 50 U.S. states (aggregate at state level; can extend to HHS regions if useful for modeling).

## DATA
Census population data and DCD Influenza Deaths data from 2009 till 2017 across all States of America

## HYPOTHESES
Age‑severity gradient: Individuals ≥60 exhibit higher influenza mortality than those <60.

## TOOLS 
- Excel for combining several data-sheets, hypothesis testing and analysis
- Tableau for data representation, visualization and reporting

## CONCLUSION AFTER ANALYSIS 
To achieve our objective, I conducted a thorough analysis of data and predictions for the year 2018. Following research, I identified two groups of people and determined the most vulnerable one individuals aged 65 and older. The correlation analysis highlighted a robust relationship between the number of deaths and the population size within this age group. Subsequently, I pinpointed states with the highest incidence of influenza deaths. In addition to predicting influenza deaths for those over 65, I extended our forecasts to individuals under 65.
The next crucial step involves planning for staff allocation, a resource-intensive process, particularly during the influenza season. To guide this allocation effectively, I consider all relevant graphs, charts, and maps highlighting vulnerable areas with the highest influenza death rates.
